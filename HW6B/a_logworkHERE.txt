JAMES THOMPSON:



ALEC BAKER:
NOVEMBER 28
  - Set up initial github repository
  - Created PassOne read to parse the source code input file
    into codeline attributes, create the codeline object, and store 
    the into codelines_ vector
DECEMBER 2
  - Added error checking for symbols when setting up symbol table 
    in pass one to handle the following errors: symbols are 1-3 chars,
    must start with an alphanumberic character, and must oly be
    alphanumberic.
  ** Below were with help of James and Ethan **
  - added error checking for invalid mnemoics, undefined symbols,
    DS and ORG outside of memory. now handles all xinsource files
    properly.
    

CHRISTOPHER WALLS:



JAMES COCHRAN:
NOVEMER 28 5pm - 11pm:
  - Completed symboltable_ map functionality. 
  - With assistance from Ethan and Chris, completed PassOne() and PassTwo()
    funtionality, to the extent they work on source codes that have no 
    errors within them.
NOVEMBER 29 12am - 1am 
  - Changed the way we initialized maps
  - added this files: a_logworkHERE.txt & a_whatNEXT.txt in 'HW6B' directory
    and added mycpplint to 'group8_hwprog6' directory 
  - Made our files only dump codeline and symboltable_ contents to log_stream
    and still dumps some to out_stream, but correct execution will show in 
    'zmylog.txt' assuming you have followed something along the lines of:
     make -f ../../makefile 
    ./Aprog ../../ytestban.txt zmyout zmylog.txt
    in the 'group8_hwprog6' directory.
DECEMBER 1 10am - 11am 
  - Added DS and ORG functionality, that needs to be tested more.
  - Code catches if a symbol has been multiply defined.
  - Added Buell's example source codes and respected logs in the HW6B directory.
ETHAN WEAVER:
November 29 10:30 - 12:15
  - Made it print the machine code to zmylog.txt
  - Corrected the handeling of END for pc_in_assembler_
  - Changed the handeling of the hex's machine_code
    - has it clear the current string of machine_code
    - converted the integer representation of the hex as a 16 bit binay string
    - set that to machine_code
  - cleanup up out_stream dumps
    - only thing going to out_stream now is the machine_code
  - changed the Modified By: 'placeholdername' to show Group 8
